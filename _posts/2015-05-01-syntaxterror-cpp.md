## Backstory

You may want to [skip](#) this part, as it is only a tiny backstory, of why I write this article.

Before I digged into C++ programming I tried to teach it myself from the very basics by learning C-syntax first. So I bought [_"C from A to Z"_](http://openbook.rheinwerk-verlag.de/c_von_a_bis_z/) and read it in a couple of days.  
Unfortunately this book gave me almost nothing valuable. Either I already knew the basic stuff like loops and such, or it kind of failed to teach me the things I didn't know of, in my case it was the pointer-drama.  
(Back in the days I always asked myself why I have to use the `*`-operator to declare a variable and then use the same operator to dereference it again to refer to the actual object.)

## What is this weird syntax?
